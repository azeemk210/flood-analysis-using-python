# Analyse-floods-using-python-only

Analyzing climate change and potential flooding is incredibly important as our world changes, and one way to do this is to use Python and GIS data known as digital elevation models. In this project,I will create a relative elevation model, or model the data relative to the height of a body of water, in this case, the Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, MO.
